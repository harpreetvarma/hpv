git has put some text like this     

change 1
change 2
change 3
change 4      
<<<< HEAD  // change made in current branch
change 6
=======
change 5
>>>> master  // change made in source branch

the use of this is that git 
automatically tells where the
changes are being made in master & branch

i removed that extra content that git has 
put in and then i did commit

git commit -a -m 'merge conflict resolved'
